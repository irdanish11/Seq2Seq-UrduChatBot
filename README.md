To run this program successfully the following requirements mustbe fullfilled.
Anaconda with Python 3.6 or higher
Tensorflow Version 1.13.1

1. Anaconda. 
	Download Anaconda from https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/
	Install Anaconda

2. Tensorflow 1.13.1
	If you already installed the anaconda and tensorflow. Check version of your Tensorflow Installation.
	Open Anaconda Prompt and write 'python' and hit enter.
	Python command line interface will open. In there write following python lines to check your version of Tensorflow.
	>>>import tensorflow as tf
	>>>print(tf.__version__)
	If the result is 1.13.1 then you are good to go. Just Double Click the 'Urdu Virtual Assistant' icon on your desktop.
	If the webpage is not loaded wait for 20 seconds and reload the page or hit the F5 key.

	If the version of your Tensorflow Installation is not 1.0.0 then you have to uninstall your current Tensorflow.
	Open Anaconda Prompt and write the following command.
	```shell
	pip uninstall tensorflow
	```
	You will be asked to 'Procees (y/n)?' enter 'y' and hit enter key.
	After uninstallation enter the following command in Anaconda Prompt to Install Tensorflow 1.13.1
	```shell
	pip install tensorflow==1.13.1
	```
	and hit enter.
	After installation Just Double Click the 'Urdu Virtual Assistant' icon on your desktop.
	If the webpage is not loaded wait for 20-40 seconds and reload the page or hit the F5 key.
